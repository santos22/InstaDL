# InstaDL
Chrome Extension that painlessly allows users to download images off of Instagram! Improvements coming soon...

## Navigate to the Instagram photo you want to download. An example URL would be:
### https://instagram.com/p/5Nmq-FsoKW/?taken-by=realmadrid

## Refresh the page and now the URL reads:
### https://instagram.com/p/5Nmq-FsoKW/

# Click on the InstaDL browser icon and your download should start immediately, voila!
